In this challenge, I will create Python scripts to analyze a financial dataset and a poll dataset.
Instructions:
Read in budget_data csv file to Python script to calculate the total number of months, the net total amount of profit/losses, the changes in profit/losses, the average of those changes, and the greatest decrease/increase in profits.
Read in election_data csv file to another Python script to calculate the total number of votes, complete list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, total number of votes each candidate won, the winner of the election based on popular vote.
Print results to both terminal and text file.
Push these Python scripts and results into Git Hub.
